This program currently aproximates light paths by using Newtonian gravity and treating light as massive particles. This still gives a somewhat accurate image because the Einstein field equations fall back on Newtonian gravity when the forces are not very strong.

I'm working on implementing the Kerr black hole, which will actually use the Kerr solution instead of an aproximation.
